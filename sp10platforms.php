Dear Gamma Gamma, <br /><br />

Attending sectionals this weekend really reaffirmed my opinions on what APhiO is and why I dedicate myself to the chapter. Spending an entire day surrounded by 500 other IC brothers who are just as dedicated to service, prideful of their chapter and excited to be a part of APhiO will do that to you. Being able to interact with IC brothers, listen to what other chapters are doing, and generally seeing the "big picture" of all that we do, along with all of the passion and potential that our chapter has, makes my decision to run for Service Vice President a very easy one. I know that I want to give back to our chapter and help to shape our ever-changing programs. The best way I see to do this is to run for the position of Service Vice President. <br /><br />

I have had the position of SVP in mind ever since I crossed, but this is the first semester that I really feel that I am qualified for the job. Service has been my focus ever since pledging. I have done on average around 50 hours each semester, 80 for probationary semester, and was also on the service committee. I was also service trainer for JM PComm, which is where I learned a lot about the processes of what SVP would do, just on a smaller scale. I got used to finding service projects and communicating with outside organization, and was also a key information point for any questions pledges had about service requirements and projects. This semester I seemed to have strayed farther from the service program than I have in the past, acting as IC chair and banquet chair, but I have also had the opportunity to get more involved in the inter-workings of our chapter and am more familiar now with the way that our chapter functions as a whole. Because of my two years of experience in APhiO, I feel that I could talk comfortably about any one of our ongoing service projects, and know what kind of service projects work well for our chapter. <br /><br />

Some ideas I have for improving our already wonderful service program include hosting an IC service project on campus, as well as joining IC brothers for service projects around the bay. The connections I have made as IC chair will make this easier to execute than semesters in the past. I would also like to implement one service project with another organization on campus. One priority of mine for service will be accessibility, which includes both projects that are easily accessible by transportation so we won't have to rely as heavily on our drivers, as well as accessibility for different schedules, making sure that there are service projects available at varying times throughout the week. I would also like to focus our attention on National Service Week in November and get more involved with that than we have in the past.<br /><br />

As hopefully all of you know, we were awarded the Service Gold Pan for our section, which means that we have the best service program around. I hope that I am given the opportunity to maintain and possibly improve our already exceptional service program, which is essentially the foundation of our fraternity. I would be much honored to represent our chapter in this way.<br /><br />

In Leadership, Friendship and Service, <br />
Courtney McLaughlin<br /><br />

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Alpha Phi Omega stands upon  three cardinal principles: Leadership Friendship, and Service. I believe that after pledging and being an active for half of my college career at Berkeley, APO has helped me strengthen these three principles by recognizing its importance and the true meaning behind them. I have  taken on various large and small roles in the chapter that has allowed me  to work at different environments under a diverse amount of Excomm positions and with different kinds of constraints. Not only has APO helped me understand these three principles, it has also helped me become a leader for the chapter and community. As pledgemaster, I would like to guide future pledges to embody Leadership, Friendship and Service and ultimately become good actives that will carry on the chapter's traditions. <br /><br />

I am a strong believer of unity and recognize that excellent work is not accomplished by one single person but by several people working together. As pledgemaster, I would like to foster unity among the pledge class by emphasizing pledge class bonding events and bonding exercises. Due to the fact that previous pledge classes have been  large, a united pledge class has been difficult to bring about. I believe that through good communication and connection within the pledge class, I can motivate and inspire the future pledges to take pride for their class. Unity will be built in the pledge class by creating a welcoming environment where they can feel and acknowledge that they are an important asset to the chapter during their pledging and active semesters. <br /><br />

In addition, I would like to instill new, as well as old, traditions of the chapter to the pledge class to ensure that traditions are not lost along the way. There are reasons why traditions exist and I am open to new traditions to make the pledge program more enjoyable for both Actives and Pledges alike. <br /><br />

I believe that unity among the pledge class is also triggered by the unity of the pledge committee The pledgemaster and Pcomm trainers exert a great influence over pledges and they are the main actives that make up APO's image through the eyes of the pledges. They are the basis of how pledges will turn out as actives, and as pledgemaster, I want to instill unity and teamwork in my pledge committee to serve as an example for the pledge class. Additionally, individual pledge committees also influence each pledge's pledging experience and their involvement during the pledging process. As pledgemaster, I would like to motivate my Pcomm to dedicate their time and reach out to their pledges, and encourage them to become involved by taking active roles in their commitees or in excomm committees. I also plan to encourage more inter-committee interaction and encourage trainers to reach out to pledges outside of their committees. <br /><br />

As pledgemaster, I will facilitate pledges, bigs and parents by having a closer communication with them. Regarding the faciliatation of different parties, I feel that I am the best candidate.  The different roles I held, such as Pledge, Big, Pcomm trainer and Pledge parent, reveal my well-rounded knowledge and skills needed to bring about the higher unity and communication within APO. I have looked at the pledge program through a variety of different and distinct lenses and feel that I can relate to each person in APO. I had the opportunity to become a pledgeparent where I was able to look at the different perspectives throughout the pledging semester from a different angle but still able to understand how different parties react towards the pledging program. Pledges have come talked to me about their worries, their questions about the fraternity, how to succeed as a pledge, what happens when they become an active, and of course, complaints. With this experience, I was able to sympathize with what pledges and Bigs go through without the Pcomm authority. As a pledgemaster, I can include my observations that I have seen this semester to closely collaborate with the pledge committee in lessening the pledges' stress and miscommunication, and being able seeing the pledge program from the pledge's perspective. <br /><br />

I will also be easily accessible to pledges at all times to develop a relationship with pledges in person. I believe that requirements for signature sheet should be easier to reduce pledges' stress to get signatures. I recognize that the purpose of the signature sheet is to get to know Pcomm and Excomm, and learn the different administrative roles in APO. However, I believe that pledges could obtain their signatures at a less stressful environment. With this note, I also want to strongly encourage Pcomm and Excomm to reach out to pledges by holding Office Hours regularly and have one-on-ones early on in the semester.<br /><br />

In regards to the pledge program, I plan to integrate bonding exercises or more opportunities where pledges can meet other pledges and actives. I also plan to make lecture time more efficient or shorter during PRs and take advantange of the time left for the pledge class to bond. <br /><br />

I do plan to keep the pledge parent position in the future. The pledge parent position can serve as an additional tool for pcomm as well as being the foundation of trust for pledges and actives.  With that in mind, the pledge parent can be whom the actives and pledges go to with problems, questions, or doubts during the pledging semester. I plan to have the pledge parent communicate with small families to have inter-small family bonding events so pledges and actives can meet other people outside of their small families. The pledge parent will also work alongside with the PCP in terms of planning events and guide the PCP lead the pledge class to a better direction. With the help from the pledge parents, the gap of miscommunication or misinformation can be narrowed among, Pcomm, pledges, and Actives. <br /><br />

Thank you for reading my platform and please keep in mind the issues I have pointed out above when voting for pledgemaster.<br /><br />

"A good leader inspires people to have confidence in the leader; a great leader inspires people to have confidence in themselves."-Anonymous<br /><br />

Pledgemaster: a position that comes with great rewards, yet great sacrifices. I’ve been in Alpha Phi Omega for almost 4 semesters now and I truly believe that I possess the necessary qualities that not only successfully mold pledges into quality actives but also instill in them the good morals and values on which our fraternity was founded. Morals such as respect and responsibility towards other brothers are important because we are essentially a family. Values such as trustworthiness and dedication to the chapter are also important because it’s what defines us. I also believe that I can successfully mentor the pledge committee because I will provide them with my knowledge and experience in leadership, which I have acquired throughout my lifetime. <br /><br />

Why would I want to sacrifice my last semester at UC Berkeley to become Pledgemaster? I have seen people going into their last semester of college want to leave this institution with less stress as possible. I, on the other hand, feel I still can do something to help make a difference in this chapter. I have been actively involved in this fraternity since I pledged during Fall 2008 Wilfred Krenek semester. This semester, I have grown as person by taking on multiple responsibilities such as parenting and chairing big events, and I have also grown as a leader. The outcomes of this semester have proven to me that I can take on big responsibilities successfully. Seeing our chapter unity and pride during this past sectionals makes me proud to be a part of this chapter, and I am honored to have taken a part in this change. This convinces me that by working together as a team, we can accomplish anything.<br /><br />

With an emphasis on team, I will have a pledge committee that stresses communication and togetherness. This will apply to the pledge committee and the pledges, the pledge committee and the bigs, as well as within the pledge committee itself. Although the pledge committee is seen as a separate entity, I want to encourage open communication with the bigs and providing them with the necessary updates and tools on their respective littles. I will do this through emailing each family the necessary requirements for each committee as well as signature requirements. I will also have a meeting with the pledge committee and a representative of each small family during progress reports in which we will demonstrate each pledge’s strengths and weaknesses. I believe that by working as a team with the pledge committee and the bigs, then the chances of improvement within the pledge class is favorable. <br /><br />

As a leader, I will not only set a good example for the pledges, but also for the pledge committee. I plan on attending as many service events and fellowships as possible. I will encourage the pledge committee to do the same as well. As many of you know, I have spent several years in the U.S. Air Force. I know how to be a leader and to work as a team because teamwork is what the military stresses. I believe that my strongest characteristics were acquired during my time in the military. I have the ability to multitask efficiently. I am also a great listener. I will stress to the pledge committee and the pledges to come to me if they have any questions or need any advice. I have also been in a managerial position in many jobs and what I’ve learned is that if you take care of the people that you are responsible for, then the more likely that you will have a positive outcome. Making sure that the pledges and the pledge committee are performing to their full potential will be some of my goals. <br /><br />

Pledge class unity is another theme that I want to stress. With each new semester, we see a growing number of pledges. This can prove to be intimidating for pledges. I will encourage pledge class bonding through such events as inter-committee, where pledges will have a chance to get to know other pledge brothers in a small setting. Trainers will also have the opportunity to build stronger one on one relations with pledges outside of office hours and other events with inter-committee bonding events. As Pledgemaster, I will also hold bonding events with pledges where I will invite a few pledges every week and have lunch/dinner so I can get to know them outside of office hours. <br /><br />

I want trainers to create a hands-on environment with their trainees. They will take an active role in being role models to them. They will also assist their trainees in any way possible in order for them to learn their roles in their respective committees. If a pledge has a question pertaining to their chairing of a pledge class event, I want the pledges to feel confident in relying on their trainers with answers or advice. I want the trainers to provide a good example and work just as hard as the trainees. By going over and providing a detailed list of each trainer’s responsibility from the beginning, I believe that they will perform to their potential. I strongly believe the pledge committee program is designed not just to see the successful crossing of worthy pledges into activehood, but I believe that the program is also a learning experience for the pledge committee so that they will take on more leadership roles, such as Excomm, successfully. <br /><br />

On a last note, I would like to say that my pledging semester as well as serving on pledge committee are two of the most memorable times in my college years. I would like to provide a positive environment for both Pcomm and pledges and hopefully provide the best memories for them. I am fully dedicated and ready to fulfill my duties as Pledgemaster. 

In Leadership, Friendship, and Service,<br />
Ali Carbonel<br /><br />

Dearest Gamma Gamma Chapter,<br /><br />

Throughout my active career in Alpha Phi Omega, I've always felt the need
to give back to the community that made me so much of who I am now. As a
pledge, I was the quietest, most awkward person ever, but I've felt myself
grow and change every semester since. I uncled for Dip n' Dots WK
semester, and I began to realize how bad of a pledge I was from the
perspective of an active. Subsequently, I bigged for Pineapple Express ST
semester, Hot Pockets JM semester, and Pimped Out Penguins this semester.
My approach to bigging has never changed: get the littles involved, and
they will find ways to enjoy themselves throughout the semester.Keeping
my own failings as a pledge in mind, I try to make sure that my littles
avoid the mistakes I made.<br /><br />

At this point, you may be wondering why I'm telling you all this. Well,
to be honest, since a lot of you probably don't know me, this is my
introduction to you. APO has consumed the majority of my college life,
and my small fam constitutes a large part of my identity every semester. 
But more importantly, the attitude I bring to bigging is a perfect
indicator of how I would handle the position of Admin VP.<br /><br />

The office entails three main responsibilities: organizing, editing, and
overseeing the production of the Stylus; maintaining, repairing, and
improving the Chapter Website; and reserving rooms for any events that
require them. Admittedly, there isn't much I can do in terms of improving
the room reservation process. I can only promise to do it in a timely
fashion as to be competitive in the selection process, and to consider
many things that would make everyone's lives easier, such as location,
number of electrical outlets, and room temperature. However, the other
two tasks are indeed areas which can, and to the best of my abilities,
will be improved upon.<br /><br />

The chapter website is a great tool for all of us, and it has been
well-conceived and maintained.  I won't go into detail here, but there are
multiple areas that my officers/committee and I would work with to
streamline and to improve the user interface for a more enjoyable
experience.  Specifically, I will try to make it easier to track one's
progress through your requirements, and to make it easier to plan out
one's semester in terms of these requirements with focused calendars.  I
won't know exactly how these changes are going to be implemented until I
dive into the code, but these are my general goals.<br /><br />

The Stylus is where I would enact the broadest changes, beginning with the
layout.  Newspapers have multiple sections, clearly labeled, so that you
can find the kind of information you want more easily.  While our Stylus
may not be large enough to merit this elaborate structural overhaul,
rearranging and grouping articles together by theme or content and then
labelling them under a section title, which would be listed in a table of
contents, shouldn't be very hard and allows us to find what we're looking
for, especially when skimming through older Styluses for something
specific.<br /><br />

Incentives to write for the Stylus should, in my opinion, follow the
pattern we have for paying dues.  Those who write for earlier Styluses
would get a larger portion of a leadership credit than those who write for
later Styluses.  This will bring more submissions overall, but will also
even out the sizes of early and late semester Styluses.  Hopefully, with
some changes to the website, we can start to track leadership credits,
even in this fractional form.<br /><br />

Finally, I realize that the Stylus is completely black and white to save
time and money, but some submissions simply lose their effect and charm
when stripped of color.  So, a change that I would propose for discussion
is the introduction of 2 colored pages, which would be largely reserved
for pictures, cartoons, optical illusions, and other graphics.<br /><br />

Being a part of ExComm would be a true honor, and would also allow me the
opportunity to make a larger impact in the community that I serve, and
which has served me so profoundly in return.  I've been around for a while
now, and have experienced ideas and changes that work, and others that
haven't worked very well.  Taking a position of relative prominence gives
me the chance to suggest and test some ideas that are not related to my
position, but to ExComm in general.  Lastly, being a big so many times has
allowed me to connect with both pledges and actives, and has given me
insight into the stresses associated with various periods of the semester.
I hope to be an approachable member of ExComm who anybody can work with
to try to relieve these tensions.<br /><br />

Thanks for reading all this!  I don't think I'd ever write a Stylus
article this long...<br /><br />

With Leadership, Friendship, and Service in my heart,<br />
Hobart Lai

Gamma Gamma, <br /><br />

I remember during my pledging semester I thought that I would not take on higher leadership roles as an active. I applied for rush chair, half wanting it and half to please my big and trainers but actively being rush chair brought the chapter closer to heart. The well being of the chapter lies with active members as well as new pledges and I want to be the one who has a hand in maintaining the future of the chapter through its members.<br /><br />

<b>Retention</b><br /><br />

GO, GO, GO GAMMA GAMMA, GO, GO, GO BERKLEYY! (repeat x infinite) <br /><br />

I believe that having high chapter spirit is a large factor in active retention. If you have spirit, if you love Gamma Gamma, then why would you want to leave something you love? Going to sectionals for the first time I was skeptical at whether or not it would be enjoyable or just a drag—and I am definitely glad that I attended. I think that it was so enjoyable because every chapter there was so spirited which fueled our chapter to show all of them how amazing we are. This semester’s spirit chairs did a phenomenal job with creating a new cheer, getting lots of people to do roll call, rallying the attendees to cheer their hearts out and I’m sure Section 4 KNOWS Gamma Gamma. With that kind of momentum, it would be a shame if it our spirit did not expand and continue.<br /><br />

However, aside from having love for our chapter and raising our chapter spirit I also believe that for retention, the MVP has to be able to remind actives of why they are here to begin with—why did they pledge? Are they still here for the same reasons? What has changed that would make them consider deactivating? What can be done to keep them? <br /><br />

These past three semesters that I have been in the chapter, I have noticed that everything revolves around pledges and that actives often time get neglected. I understand that not everyone may have the time to be in the family system or they may not have the desire to do so and in turn they are unable to meet the pledges and feel disconnected from the chapter. Although there is no simple solution for this, I would provide the opportunity for actives to meet pledges by organizing active-pledge events—I can’t force people outside families to attend these but the opportunity would be there and it would be something like interfam but outside the family system. I want to bring back active spotlight to highlight outstanding actives and let them know that we value them still after crossing.<br /><br />

<b>Rush</b><br /><br />

Our chapter is able to continue on semester after semester because of rush. Rush is one of the most important periods for the chapter. We continue to substantially increase in size every semester, which has its pros and cons. On one hand, we welcome anyone who wishes to join our chapter, but on the other hand I feel as if we should not grow so large that we do not know all the brothers. Maybe if we shorten rush, we will decrease the number of new pledges coming in. There is always talk of shortening rush, but I really do think that it is possible by either starting the Monday following CM1 or cutting out tabling on Fridays. I’m sure that some of you are raising red flags and wondering “how can 200 people get all their tabling hours done with less time?” With the chapter so large, the amount of tabling hours per person could be reduced to accommodate it. <br /><br />

Rush should be a time where the chapter comes together with a common goal: ensuring the future of the chapter by recruiting new members.<br /><br />

<b>Family System</b><br /><br />

I think that this area is what it is and is hard to improve and hard to change. If elected, I would not be a part of any family to assure the bigs and parents that I am trying my best to reduce any kind of bias. Though I don’t really understand how there can be a bias because I don’t understand how one can deem one person a “good” pledge and another a “bad” pledge when the semester has barely started. I hope that with families bigs and parents understand that I gave an honest effort to try to mix people up and that on their end they will have an open mind and welcome whomever into their families without prior judgment of who is “bad” and who is “good”<br /><br />

Since the MVP is like the “big of bigs” I would try to check up on bigs/parents on a regular basis and make sure things are going well and answer and questions if there are any. <br /><br />

“Sibweek” has been tossed around for the past few semesters and I want to try to execute this the first week of pledging, that is starting the Wednesday after ritual and into PR0/sibsocial. I honestly haven’t figured out the details or what it would entail but my hope is that it would lessen any fears on the pledges part and give the bigs an idea who their littles are. <br /><br />

I hope I have the opportunity to fill this position and execute my plans, and hopefully increase our active retention improve the overall membership of the chapter.<br /><br />

</h2>
<div style="max-width: 50em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Hello Gamma Gamma Brothers,
<br />
Iím Chris Nguyen and I pledged ST semester.  I am running for Fellowship VP because I feel as if there are many fellowship aspects of APO that I can expand and improve upon with the position.  The three main pillars of fellowship that I want to emphasize will be intrachapter, interchapter, and alumni relations.  
</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">Intrachapter</h3>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
Something that a lot of the older actives have lamented on is the fact that our chapter has gotten so large in the past few semesters.  It is therefore so much more difficult for pledges and actives alike to get to know each other on a first name basis, let alone consider each other a Brother.  Forming strong bonds with others is one of the most appealing aspects of APO, and I want to create more opportunities to allow members to do so despite the exponential growth of our organization.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
One thing I want to do is start off the semester with a bang in order to motivate actives to attend fellowships early on instead of waiting for the new pledge class.  Previous Fellowship VPs have told me that the beginning of the semester has always been a dull time because actives simply do not feel like coming out to APO fellowships during the Rush weeks.  However, I believe if there is a large chapter-wide event, maybe something similar to GG Picnic back in JM semester or GG Olympics, to kick the semester off, members may get excited for another semester of APO much more quickly.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
The idea of the APO Hotspot was a brilliant one and I have already discussed with the current MVP about taking it over, because I feel that the program would be much more appealing under the Fellowship banner.  During Rush, there were plenty of times where I would see members just chilling and hanging out at the table, getting to know each other in a lax and laid back environment.  I personally have gotten to know a good number of actives at the table that I would never have even met otherwise.  Members who just got out of class would be able to just come to the Hotspot and bond with other actives or pledges in their free time.  It is even possible to advertise for APOís fundraisers in this manner.  Establishing the logistics early on, months before next semester starts, would allow the APO Hotspot program to truly take off and run much more smoothly in the Fall.  As of right now, I hope to have Hotspot run every day of the week so as many members as possible can take part.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I also intend to create large-scale chapter-wide fellowships at least once a month to ensure that members have the chance to keep contact with all their Brothers and not just their inner circle of friends on a constant basis.  Again, these events will be on the scope of something like GG Picnic or GG Olympics and will be publicized weeks in advance to ensure high attendance and enthusiasm.  It is important for us as a chapter to truly bond with each and every other member if we are to be considered Brothers.  
</p>

I also want to create weekly fellowships that appeal to a large variety of people.  Something that I will bring back are the food fellowships that explore restaurants that are not commonly frequented by Berkeley students.  Tasty Thursdays and Fatty Fridays were past fellowships that did this exact task, yet they have sadly disappeared in recent semesters.  Simple outdoor field days that encourage physical activities or sports games would also be a great opportunity to bond and build a sense of teamwork with your brothers.

<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
The IC events have always been a great chance to get to know Brothers from other chapters across the state.  However, there always seems to be a pattern in which we, Gamma Gamma, tend to flock into our own circle and mingle with each other rather than IC Brothers.  Therefore, IC brothers can sometimes have trouble initiating conversation with us since there are so many of us and it can be intimidating to approach us all.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I intend to add maybe one more IC event to our calendar.  Although I have not yet decided the exact nature of the event yet, I will be discussing it further with other members to finalize the logistics.  The event, however, will most definitely be structured in such a way that encourages interaction with brothers from other chapters, possibly involving teams composed of members from more than one chapter.  An idea is a scavenger hunt, similar to Iota Phiís, that would disperse various Gamma Gammas amongst other brothers to foster the interchapter interaction.  Whatever the event eventually ends up being, it will prevent us from socializing only amongst ourselves and will encourage us to talk to IC brothers.

It is very important for us to understand how APO is run in other chapters in order to better comprehend the different methods of implementing leadership, friendship, and service across the various chapters of the nation.  In order to accomplish this, we must be willing to take the first step and come outside our safety zone of already close friends.  
</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">Alumni</h3>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I believe that events like Alumni Panel were strokes of pure genius.  APO has such a vast alumni network that it would be a shame not to utilize their knowledge to our benefit.  I would love to work with next semesterís Historian in order to bring more of these types of events to our calendar.  There are a lot of things that our alumni can teach us about life after our undergraduate years, and having the opportunity to talk to them gives us the chance to learn about APO from a different perspective.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
On the fellowship side of things, Iíd like to set up more events that allow us to have fun with the alumni, in addition to stuff like Alumni Bonfire.  Some ideas that I am considering are basketball or football games, cooking, rock climbing, or biking to San Francisco.  These activities appeal to all types of people, including alumni and actives alike, and will let new members learn about the roots of the chapter while older members can see the new directions that our chapter is taking.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
I have met such a great number of fantastic people in my time at APO, and it was sad to see so many of them graduate and move on.  After this semester, even more awesome people will be leaving our chapter.  I want to keep those bonds between these future alumni and the continuing members strong as well as allow new pledges to meet firsthand those who have contributed so much to the history of Gamma Gamma in a fellowship environment.

Dear Gamma Gamma, 
<br />
	Having been an Active member of Alpha Phi Omega in the last 2 years I would like to become your historian VP for this coming semester. My experience, qualifications, and enthusiasm for this position would make me a great Historian VP. I have been very involved in the chapteró particularly working under the Historian VPs that we have had in the past. I have gained lots of experience in regards to what a historian VP role entails and I loved it in the process. Not only have I worked under the Historian VPs but I have taken various opportunities to grow as a leader in APhiO; therefore I am prepared for this next step. 
	</p>
<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">	
	A Historian VP is traditionally thought to be someone who can take pictures, does arts and crafts, makes pretty photo-shopped things, but I believe that the position entails more than that. Of course, I fit all those other qualifications, but more importantly a Historian VP is a leader, and she needs to be able to work with other people, effectively organize the events, and be a great resource for those in her committee whenever they need it. I am a person who can do all those things. I am friendly, organized, approachable, efficient, and enthusiastic and above all, I believe APhiO has helped me become the leader that I am today. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
	There are two main issues that always come up for a Historian VP and I have solutions for both of them. The first is Alumni Relations. As Alumni Relations Chair this semester we have brought in new Alumni events that have been a success!! At Alumni panel we had 12 alumni show up and hey offered invaluable advice to the members. As chair, I have now established relationships with the alumni and know that they are willing and very interested in coming back. They are really helpful and I want the chapter to recognize that. So the second part of having successful alumni relations now is not just to have these events, but to have the chapter show interest in forging connections with the alumni. I plan on doing that by having alumni spotlight every CM to show what distinguished alumni did for APhiO and what they are doing now. This will help bring the alumni and current members closer together.
	</p>
	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
	Another issue that we have is the representation of families in our APhiO media (pictures, funpack, slideshow, etc..) . Previous H-VPs have addressed this problem by introducing photobucket, and now smugmug. An additional solution to this problem is to have a photo committee. I know that there are many people in our chapter who love to take photos and I want to give these people the responsibility and recognition for what they already do! I will work with the committee to encourage them to not be afraid of taking pictures of people in other families, and will make sure that there is a balanced representation of all the brothers in Gamma Gamma! 
	</p>
	<p style="margin: 1.5em 0px;">
All in all, I believe that I am the best candidate for Historian VP and have come a long way to prepare myself to take this leadership position. I am an artsy, photo-loving, friendly, approachable, organized, enthusiastic leader. I would really love to become your Historian VP and I am looking forward for your support!
